Q-1. A university wants to understand the relationship between the SAT scores of its applicants and their college GPA. They collect data on 500 students, including their SAT scores (out of 1600) and their college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). They find that the correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7. What does this correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA?


Ans :- The correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA.

A correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. In this case, a positive correlation coefficient indicates that as SAT scores increase, college GPA tends to increase as well. The magnitude of the correlation coefficient (0.7) suggests a relatively strong relationship, meaning that there is a consistent pattern of higher SAT scores being associated with higher college GPAs among the sample of 500 students.

However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While this correlation coefficient suggests a relationship between SAT scores and college GPA, it does not indicate that SAT scores directly cause higher college GPAs. There may be other factors at play that contribute to the observed correlation, such as study habits, motivation, or other personal characteristics.
