Q-4. A group of 20 friends decide to play a game in which they each write a number between 1 and 20 on a slip of paper and put it into a hat. They then draw one slip of paper at random. What is the probability that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square (i.e., 1, 4, 9, or 16)?

Ans:- To calculate the probability that the number drawn from the hat is a perfect square (1, 4, 9, or 16), we need to determine the total number of favorable outcomes (slips of paper with perfect square numbers) and the total number of possible outcomes (all slips of paper).

Total number of possible outcomes:
Since there are 20 friends and each friend writes a number between 1 and 20, the total number of possible outcomes is 20.

Total number of favorable outcomes:
There are four perfect square numbers between 1 and 20: 1, 4, 9, and 16. Each of the 20 friends could have written any of these four numbers. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 20 * 4 = 80.

Probability of drawing a perfect square:
The probability is the ratio of the total number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

Probability = (Total number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)
Probability = 80 / 20
Probability = 4/1
Probability = 4

Therefore, the probability that the number drawn from the hat is a perfect square is 4/20, which simplifies to 1/5 or 0.2.
