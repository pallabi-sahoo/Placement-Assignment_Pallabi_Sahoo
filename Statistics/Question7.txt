and . 2𝑋 + 3 − 8 = 0 2𝑌 + 𝑋 − 5 = 0 The variance of 𝑋 = 4 Find the
a. Variance of Y
b. Coefficient of determination of C and Y
c. Standard error of estimate of X on Y and of Y on X.

Ans:- To calculate the variance of Y, we can rearrange the equation of the regression line for Y: 2Y + X - 5 = 0

Solving for Y:
2Y = -X + 5
Y = (-1/2)X + 5/2

Since the equation for Y is in the form Y = aX + b, where a is the coefficient of X and b is the intercept, we can determine the variance of Y.

a. Variance of Y:
The variance of Y can be calculated using the formula: Var(Y) = a^2 * Var(X)

Given that the variance of X is 4, we substitute the values:
Var(Y) = (-1/2)^2 * 4
Var(Y) = 1 * 4
Var(Y) = 4
Therefore, the variance of Y is 4.

b. Coefficient of determination of X and Y:
The coefficient of determination, denoted as R^2, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Y) that can be explained by the independent variable (X).
R^2 = (Var(Y) - Var(residuals)) / Var(Y)
The variance of the residuals can be calculated by subtracting the explained variance from the total variance:
Var(residuals) = Var(Y) - Var(explained)

In this case, the variance of the residuals is the same as the variance of Y since the regression line explains all the variance.
Var(residuals) = Var(Y) = 4

Substituting the values:
R^2 = (4 - 4) / 4
R^2 = 0 / 4
R^2 = 0

Therefore, the coefficient of determination (R^2) between X and Y is 0.

c.The standard error of estimate represents the average distance between the observed values and the predicted values obtained from the regression line.
For the standard error of estimate of X on Y (Sxy), we use the formula:

Sxy = sqrt(Var(residuals))
Sxy = sqrt(4)
Sxy = 2

For the standard error of estimate of Y on X (Syx), we use the same formula:
Syx = sqrt(Var(residuals))
Syx = sqrt(4)
Syx = 2

Therefore, the standard error of estimate for both X on Y (Sxy) and Y on X (Syx) is 2.
